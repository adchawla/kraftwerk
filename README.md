Portfolio of Projects related to AI/ML

This repository showcases a collection of projects I have developed while learning and experimenting with various AI/ML techniques and frameworks. Below is a brief introduction to each project within this repository:

## 01_CouponAcceptance
This project utilizes data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, collected via survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, to predict whether a customer will accept a coupon. This project was completed as part of my Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.   

## 02_WhatDrivesPriceOfCar
This project explored a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The used dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  The goal was to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of conducted analysis, a detailed recommendation was generated for the the client of such a study -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.
