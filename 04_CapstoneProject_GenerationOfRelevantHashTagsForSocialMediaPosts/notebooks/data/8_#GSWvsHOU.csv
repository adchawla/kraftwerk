"Horrible finish for the refs in the #GSWvsHOU game

How is that a foul on Kuminga, but Payton gets mugged and no call.

Honestly Billy Kennedy should be fired #GSWvsHOU,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
Honestly worst foul call ever ‚Ä¶. Billy Kennedy is the worst official in the NBA trash AF  #GSWvsHOU,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
Why is the warriors playing like this??? #GSWvsHOU https://t.co/7K2yigV0vL,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
I‚Äôm telling you right now. These great games ending with referees making calls like that is getting old. What an amazing game and it ends on a call that might be made one out of 100 times in similar situations. Gross! #GSWvsHOU,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
that is the worst foul call i‚Äôve ever seen #GSWvsHOU,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
Wow instead of the refs giving the rockets the timeout they call a foul ü§Øü§Øü§Ø  #GSWvsHOU,['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
"Warriors already have three turnovers.

Seriously, what do they do in practice? Can't stop turning the ball over and can't make free throws?

This has been a problem for multiple players for multiple years.

#GSWvsHOU",['GSWvsHOU'],en,#GSWvsHOU
That call is never made. Literally on a loose ball scramble on the ground. You could pile drive somebody and it would not be called. And in this situation? #BadCall #GSWvsHOU,"['BadCall', 'GSWvsHOU']",en,#GSWvsHOU
