I can‚Äôt believe there was a time in my life where I couldn‚Äôt tell Meredith and Lisa apart #RHOSLC https://t.co/HY0wYMRBev,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
Mary is really the only one who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck if Lisa likes her. Lisa runs those girls like the navy #rhoslc https://t.co/Y9cTqZgTPM,['rhoslc'],en,#RHOSLC
Angie tossing the shampoo and conditioner at Britani was everything #RHOSLC https://t.co/aKjzHK6hc4,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"üö® Hear me out! üö®

What if Bravo produced a show that followed Angie K‚Äôs Salon and the drama of the hairstylists? Think LA Hair meets Pump Rules?? #RHOSLC https://t.co/3hJu1xqKSF",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"I don‚Äôt go up for Lisa Barlow, but her logic was actually sound as fuck when it came to the rooms and which villa people were in. 

Bronwyn is making something out of nothing in this case. #RHOSLC https://t.co/es0CjhekXc",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
The thing about #RHOSLC is that an episode at a 50 year old‚Äôs bat mitzvah is just as good as one where homeland security storms a med spa. No one can touch this city. https://t.co/MUSFHerNXi,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
Meredith can be a friend after this season #RHOSLC https://t.co/3o6fT6Ko5N,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"#RHOSLC is so stacked with storylines they sorta just skimmed over Bronwyn getting viciously attacked by dog???? 

the way ik multiple other franchises that would have stretched that into a 5 episode story arc... https://t.co/b7tKsLeb2H",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
Now Meredith you are kind of milking this disability thing #RHOSLC https://t.co/9vnSEKHymS,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"Like her or loathe her, #RHOSLC Bronwyn has quickly proven she is NOT a newbie to be messed with!

Mama came in HOT and has kept the temperature turned up ever since.

...But is it TOO much? ü§î

Some fans seem to think so while others says she's TV gold! What do YOU think? ü§î‚ùÑÔ∏è https://t.co/lQKWIts6xg",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"Meredith really went off on Angie for ""slutshaming,"" yet turns around and sides with Lisa, who did the exact same thing to her? LMAO, talk about a double standard #RHOSLC https://t.co/zkIHLhh1Zs",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"Man, so many people can relate to Mary's son! 

You know how many people are still alive because they don't want to hurt their mom? I can't take this.  #RHOSLC https://t.co/JtehVb39uc",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"‚ÄúUnless you just have no friends, I don‚Äôt know. I mean, Heather‚Äôs plastic surgeon was there. Maybe that‚Äôs why she invited us.‚Äù

"OH, when I say Mary is CARRYING this season of #RHOSLC ‚ùÑÔ∏è

She continues to be open and honest with her son. Bringing the looks. Reading the girls. Anddd still giving comedic relief!

I stan!! https://t.co/q1jZj2DzXt",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"Bronwyn really excels in one on one's (except with Angie). Her memory is top notch, she stays focused, explains herself well and has fun little side jabs. Watching her drag Brittani, Lisa and Heather is so enjoyable #RHOSLC https://t.co/nzAeiCp8Dm",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
"Mary really went from ‚Äúwho the hell is Angie?‚Äù, to ‚ÄúAngie, I‚Äôm confiding in you‚Äù, and i love this for them!! #RHOSLC https://t.co/0BIhpOSjrD",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
I am so glad that Mary has a friend like Angie. Angie literally created a safe space for Mary to share once she was ready. And then. To hear her give Mary affirmations? Angie definitely won me over this season #RHOSLC https://t.co/LYrQhfzk6K,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC

Meredith is really pretending that she didn‚Äôt bring Shawn‚Äôs sexuality to the cameras #RHOSLC https://t.co/FKISQAT3aB,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
HIGH BODY COUNT HAIR! Give this woman an Oscar! #RHOSLC https://t.co/JBQm1F5xKS,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC

"Britani wants a hand clap from the group for spending time with her kids after fucking up the relationship cuz she chose a man over them?!

The relationship is shitty cuz you were a shitty parent! Those girls didn‚Äôt ask to be here! What a space cadet üò©üò¨
#RHOSLC https://t.co/YyKwNuimGN",['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
The way Mary trust Angie is so beautiful. I love this duo! #RHOSLC https://t.co/y6uTT8Vwix,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
Mary‚Äôs reaction to Heather saying she‚Äôs lied to all of them about her real birthday had me cackling #RHOSLC https://t.co/JFewRLhC7M,['RHOSLC'],en,#RHOSLC
